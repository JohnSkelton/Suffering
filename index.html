      <div class="card-content">
        We don’t know everything happening around us or throughout time. What appears bad may not be truly bad when unseen impacts and long-term outcomes are considered.
      </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding." — Proverbs 3:5</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-content">
        God gave us freedom to choose. Without it, love wouldn’t be genuine. Suffering is a potential consequence of that freedom. God does not arbitrarily punish; He is just.
      </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "The Lord is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love." — Psalm 103:8</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
       <div class="card-content">
        Even Satan has free will, and his judgment is yet to come. He is a significant source of suffering in the world.
       </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour." — 1 Peter 5:8</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
       <div class="card-content">
        God may allow suffering for reasons like upholding free will, enacting justice, or refining our character. <strong>Question:</strong> Why do even innocent babies and children suffer?
       </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "For I know that my Redeemer lives, and at the last he will stand upon the earth." — Job 19:25</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
       <div class="card-content">
        If God constantly intervened to prevent all suffering, it could diminish our agency and the reality of freedom.
       </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom." — 2 Corinthians 3:17</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
       <div class="card-content">
        Some suffering results directly from human decisions, such as the consequences of addiction or harmful choices. <strong>Question:</strong> Why are some seemingly saved from suffering while others are not?
       </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows." — Galatians 6:7</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
       <div class="card-content">
        Could experiencing suffering, like moving from cold and poverty to warmth and abundance, make the eventual redemption and appreciation of heaven even more profound?
       </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "The sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us." — Romans 8:18</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
       <div class="card-content">
        God may work through angels or His followers to help us. Sometimes these efforts might not prevent suffering, preserving human autonomy and choice.
       </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?" — Hebrews 1:14</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
       <div class="card-content">
        Suffering can serve as a test of our faith, endurance, and character development.
       </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "Consider it pure joy... whenever you face trials... because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance." — James 1:2–3</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
       <div class="card-content">
        This world is not intended to be perfect; perfection is reserved for heaven. Suffering exists as a consequence of sin and evil in a fallen world.
       </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world." — John 16:33</div>
    </div>
     <div class="card">
       <div class="card-content">
        Logically, guaranteeing no suffering on earth might require eliminating all evil and potentially limiting free will, contradicting God's patient desire for repentance.
       </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise... instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance." — 2 Peter 3:9</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
       <div class="card-content">
        If God personally intervened constantly to enforce His will, what purpose would remain for us or His angels as co-workers in His plan?
       </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "For we are co-workers in God’s service; you are God’s field, God’s building." — 1 Corinthians 3:9</div>
    </div>
     <div class="card">
       <div class="card-content">
        God doesn't force devotion; choosing Him is our decision. The consequences of rejecting Him are ultimately a result of that choice. Salvation comes through accepting Jesus, whom God reveals even to those unaware.
       </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son." — John 3:18</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
       <div class="card-content">
        All are invited into God's kingdom, but only those who accept Christ's righteousness are ultimately chosen. God knows who will respond, yet His invitation is for everyone.
       </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "For many are invited, but few are chosen." — Matthew 22:14</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
       <div class="card-content">
        Unpredictable events ("time and chance") happen to everyone. This reflects a world operating under natural laws, not constant divine micro-management.
       </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "The race is not to the swift or the battle to the strong... but time and chance happen to them all." — Ecclesiastes 9:11</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
       <div class="card-content">
        God's ultimate promise is not for a perfect life in *this* temporary world. Earthly trials are brief compared to the eternal glory He offers.
       </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all." — 2 Corinthians 4:17</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
       <div class="card-content">
        Some suffering results from the reliable natural laws God established. Natural events, though sometimes causing hardship, are part of the planet's necessary function.
       </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous." — Matthew 5:45</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
       <div class="card-content">
        Suffering can allow us to participate in God's redemptive work, sharing in Christ's afflictions as we carry our own cross in faith.
       </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "Now I rejoice in what I am suffering for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to Christ’s afflictions, for the sake of his body, which is the church." — Colossians 1:24</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
       <div class="card-content">
        Suffering provides contrast, deepening our appreciation for peace, joy, and love. Perhaps those who endure great hardship will have a unique perspective on heaven's restoration.
       </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away." — Revelation 21:4</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
       <div class="card-content">
        We are empowered and strengthened by overcoming difficulties, especially through the strength Christ provides.
       </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me." — Philippians 4:13</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-content">
        Witnessing suffering can evoke strong empathy and love. Since this temporary world tests character, suffering provides opportunities to grow and show compassion.
      </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 “Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn.” — Romans 12:15</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-content">
        Suffering creates opportunities to rely on God and draw closer to Him, shattering the illusion of self-sufficiency and reminding us of our dependence.
      </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 “The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit.” — Psalm 34:18</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-content">
        Suffering presents opportunities to forgive, mirroring Christ who forgave His tormentors, inviting us to extend grace.
      </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” — Luke 23:34</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-content">
        Suffering can encourage repentance and transformation by softening hearts and redirecting paths toward God.
      </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 “Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline. So be earnest and repent.” — Revelation 3:19</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-content">
        Suffering cultivates patience, as the testing of our faith produces endurance necessary for spiritual maturity.
      </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 “Knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing.” — James 1:3–4 (NKJV)</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-content">
        Shared suffering can forge stronger bonds between people, fostering deeper connection, compassion, and mutual understanding.
      </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 “Carry each other’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.” — Galatians 6:2</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-content">
        Suffering cultivates humility by reminding us of our limitations and dependence on God and others, stripping away pride.
      </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 “Humble yourselves, therefore, under God’s mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time.” — 1 Peter 5:6</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-content">
        Suffering helps put life into perspective, emphasizing eternal values over materialism and awakening us to what truly lasts.
      </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 “What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?” — Mark 8:36</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-content">
        Suffering provides powerful personal testimonies of God’s faithfulness, demonstrating His sustaining power through trials.
      </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 “They triumphed over him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony.” — Revelation 12:11</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-content">
        If adversity couldn't occur, there would be no genuine risk, and thus no true faith. Suffering allows for contrast, meaning, and the choice to trust God in the unseen.
      </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 “Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.” — Hebrews 11:1</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-content">
        The potential for betrayal makes trust meaningful, just as the possibility of failure gives value to promises and covenants. Difficulty tests and proves genuineness.
      </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "These trials will show that your faith is genuine. It is being tested as fire tests and purifies gold—though your faith is far more precious than mere gold." — 1 Peter 1:7 (NLT)</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-content">
        Through the incarnation, Christ embraced vulnerability, showing that true strength lies not in avoiding pain, but in willingly enduring it for others—a path He invites us to follow.
      </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "...Christ Jesus, who, being in very nature God... made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant... he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death—even death on a cross!" — Philippians 2:5-8</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-content">
        While the enemy can inflict worldly losses (health, possessions, relationships), our faith in Christ—the most valuable thing—cannot be taken from us if we remain steadfast.
      </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "For I am convinced that neither death nor life... nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord." — Romans 8:38–39</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-content">
        Abraham's trial with Isaac teaches that extreme tests, though appearing destructive, can be endured through unwavering faith, trusting God's unseen plan and power beyond the surface.
      </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "By faith Abraham, when God tested him, offered Isaac as a sacrifice... Abraham reasoned that God could even raise the dead, and so in a manner of speaking he did receive Isaac back from death." — Hebrews 11:17, 19</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-content">
        Suffering initiates a divine process: it produces perseverance, perseverance builds character, and character develops hope—a hope that ultimately does not disappoint.
      </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "...we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope. And hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured out into our hearts..." — Romans 5:3–5</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-content">
        We are blessed when persecuted for righteousness. Facing insults and hardship because of Christ aligns us with the prophets and promises a great reward in heaven.
      </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 “Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness... Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you... Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven...” — Matthew 5:10–12</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-content">
        True hope isn't blind optimism or despairing pessimism. It confronts suffering honestly while maintaining unwavering faith in God's ultimate goodness and deliverance (cf. Stockdale Paradox).
      </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "Yet this I call to mind and therefore I have hope: The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases; his mercies never come to an end... ‘The Lord is my portion,’ says my soul, ‘therefore I will hope in him.’" — Lamentations 3:21–24</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-content">
        Suffering is an inherent and universal part of the human experience, shared by believers throughout the world, reminding us we are not alone in our trials.
      </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "Resist him, steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same sufferings are experienced by your brotherhood in the world." — 1 Peter 5:9 (NKJV)</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-content">
        Our weaknesses and infirmities become opportunities for Christ's power to be perfected and displayed in us; His strength shines brightest when ours fails.
      </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "But he said to me, ‘My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.’ Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me." — 2 Corinthians 12:9</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-content">
        Our afflictions and comforts are interconnected; enduring suffering can bring salvation and consolation to others, just as their experiences can benefit us.
      </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "...we know that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so also you will partake of the consolation." — 2 Corinthians 1:7 (NKJV)</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-content">
        Patiently enduring suffering for doing good is commendable before God. Christ suffered unjustly, leaving an example for us to follow in His steps without sin or retaliation.
      </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow His steps..." — 1 Peter 2:21 (NKJV)</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-content">
        Though facing immense external pressures (hard-pressed, perplexed, persecuted), believers are not ultimately destroyed, demonstrating Christ's sustaining life within us.
      </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "We are hard-pressed on every side, yet not crushed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed..." — 2 Corinthians 4:8–9 (NKJV)</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-content">
        Do not lose heart; though our bodies weaken, our inner selves are renewed daily. These light, temporary afflictions achieve an eternal glory far outweighing them. Focus on the unseen eternal.
      </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "For our light affliction... is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen..." — 2 Corinthians 4:17–18 (NKJV)</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-content">
        God empowers us not just to endure evil, but to overcome it proactively by responding with goodness and love.
      </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good." — Romans 12:21 (NKJV)</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-content">
        Cast your burdens on the Lord, for He sustains the righteous and ensures ultimate justice. Trust in Him, even when facing deceitful opposition.
      </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "Cast your burden on the Lord, And He shall sustain you; He shall never permit the righteous to be moved." — Psalm 55:22 (NKJV)</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-content">
        Denying God leaves suffering without ultimate hope or justice. Belief in God offers the promise of eventual redemption, accountability, and comfort, anchoring the soul.
      </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure..." — Hebrews 6:19 (NIV)</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-content">
        Enduring trials faithfully isn't passive victimhood; it's active participation in spiritual warfare, resisting the enemy and standing firm for God's Kingdom alongside heavenly allies.
      </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities... Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground..." — Ephesians 6:12-13 (NIV)</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-content">
        God's love isn't earned by merit or perfect obedience; He loves us first, even as sinners. While transformation is lifelong, His initiating love is constant, though natural consequences for actions remain.
      </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us." — Romans 5:8 (NIV)</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-content">
        Suffering, though intensely real, is ultimately finite and purposeful. God permits trials but also sets boundaries, ensuring they serve His purpose without overwhelming us beyond His grace or our eternal hope.
      </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it." — 1 Corinthians 10:13b (NIV)</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-content">
        The ultimate answer to suffering lies in Christ's victory and the future promise of a new heaven and earth where God Himself will dwell with us, wiping away every tear and ending all pain forever.
      </div>
      <div class="verse">📖 "‘He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death’ or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away." — Revelation 21:4 (NIV)</div>
